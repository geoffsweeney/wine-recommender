## Test Timeout Issues and Route Configuration

### Problem
The test file `AdminConversationalFlow.test.ts` was failing with timeout errors. The root cause was an extremely short timeout of 100ms set with `jest.setTimeout(100);`, which was causing the tests to fail before they could complete.

### Solution
1. **Fixed timeout configuration**:
   - Removed the overly restrictive timeout setting
   - Added a proper timeout of 30 seconds using `jest.setTimeout(30000);`

2. **Updated route configuration**:
   - Modified `createRouter` in `routes.ts` to accept an `AdminCommandController` parameter
   - Updated the route definition to use this controller properly

3. **Updated test files**:
   - Fixed `AdminUserPreferenceRoutes.test.ts` to pass the required `AdminCommandController` parameter
   - Fixed `e2e_recommendations.test.ts` to pass the required `AdminCommandController` parameter
   - Added proper mocks for `AdminCommandController` in all affected test files

### Lessons Learned
1. **Timeout Configuration**: Always ensure that test timeouts are set to reasonable values that allow the tests to complete. Extremely short timeouts (like 100ms) are usually too restrictive and can cause false negatives.

2. **Route Configuration**: When modifying route configurations, ensure that all dependent test files are updated accordingly. The `createRouter` function needed to be updated to accept the `AdminCommandController` parameter, and all tests that use this function needed to be updated to pass this parameter.

3. **Mocking Controllers**: When testing with controllers, ensure that proper mocks are created and used consistently across all test files. This ensures that the tests are isolated and don't depend on actual implementations.

4. **Dependency Management**: When making changes to core components like routing, be aware of all the places that might be affected. In this case, changes to the route configuration affected multiple test files that needed to be updated accordingly.

5. **Test Isolation**: Ensure that tests are properly isolated and don't have unintended dependencies. The use of mocks helps achieve this by simulating the behavior of dependencies without actually using them.

6. **Comprehensive Testing**: When fixing issues in one test file, check for similar issues in other test files that use the same components or configurations. In this case, after fixing the timeout issue in `AdminConversationalFlow.test.ts`, we also needed to update `RecommendationRoutes.test.ts` to use the correct route configuration.

By following these principles, we can create more robust and maintainable test suites that are less likely to fail due to configuration issues or timeout problems.
