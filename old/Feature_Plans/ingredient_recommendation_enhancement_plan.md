# Plan for Enhancing Ingredient-Based Wine Recommendations

**Goal:** Improve the accuracy and relevance of wine recommendations when users provide ingredients, addressing the current observation that the application doesn't return valid wine choices for specified ingredients.

## Current Challenges

The current MVP implementation provides a basic flow for ingredient-based recommendations, but the quality and relevance of the recommendations are limited. Potential reasons for this include:
- **Input Processing:** The `InputValidationAgent` might not be extracting ingredient information with enough detail or in a format easily usable by downstream agents.
- **Agent Logic:** The `SommelierCoordinator` or `RecommendationAgent` might not be effectively utilizing the extracted ingredient information to formulate a relevant recommendation strategy.
- **Knowledge Graph Interaction:** The `KnowledgeGraphService`'s `findWinesByIngredients` method might be too simplistic, lacking sophisticated logic for ingredient-to-wine pairing or requiring more detailed input than currently provided.
- **Knowledge Graph Data:** The existing wine data in the Neo4j database might not contain sufficient information about ingredient pairings or flavor profiles relevant to ingredients.

## Proposed Enhancement Steps

To address these challenges and enhance ingredient-based recommendations, the following steps are proposed:

### Phase 1: Analysis and Refinement of Ingredient Processing

**Goal:** Improve how ingredient information is captured and processed early in the agent pipeline.

**Detailed Steps:**
- Review and potentially refine the prompt for the `InputValidationAgent` to encourage more detailed extraction of ingredient information, including preparation methods or specific characteristics if mentioned by the user.
- Analyze how the extracted ingredient information is structured and passed through the `SommelierCoordinator` to the `RecommendationAgent`. Ensure necessary data is available and correctly formatted.

### Phase 2: Enhancing Recommendation Logic for Ingredients

**Goal:** Improve the `RecommendationAgent`'s ability to generate relevant recommendations based on ingredient input.

**Detailed Steps:**
- Refine the logic within the `RecommendationAgent` to better interpret ingredient information and formulate effective queries for the `KnowledgeGraphService`.
- Consider using the LLM within the `RecommendationAgent` to help bridge the gap between raw ingredient names and wine pairing concepts if the knowledge graph interaction is purely based on exact matches.

### Phase 3: Improving Knowledge Graph Interaction and Data

**Goal:** Enhance the `KnowledgeGraphService` and potentially the underlying data to support more sophisticated ingredient-to-wine pairing.

**Detailed Steps:**
- Review and potentially enhance the `findWinesByIngredients` method in `KnowledgeGraphService` to implement more advanced querying techniques (e.g., fuzzy matching, considering related ingredients, leveraging wine characteristics known to pair well with certain ingredients).
- **(Potential Future Step):** Explore adding more detailed data to the Neo4j database regarding ingredient-to-wine pairings or flavor profiles of ingredients.

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation

**Goal:** Ensure the enhanced ingredient-based recommendations are accurate and relevant through comprehensive testing.

**Detailed Steps:**
- Update existing unit tests for `InputValidationAgent`, `SommelierCoordinator`, and `RecommendationAgent` to include test cases specifically designed to verify the improved ingredient processing and recommendation logic.
- Create new integration tests to verify the end-to-end flow for ingredient-based recommendations with various ingredient inputs, asserting on the relevance and quality of the recommendations returned.
- Conduct manual testing with a variety of ingredient inputs to assess the user experience and recommendation quality.

## Success Criteria

- The application consistently returns relevant and accurate wine recommendations when provided with ingredient-based input.
- The end-to-end tests for ingredient-based recommendations pass reliably.
- Users perceive the ingredient-based recommendations as helpful and appropriate.
