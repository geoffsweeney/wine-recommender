# Proof of Concept (POC) Progress Summary

This document summarizes the progress made on the agentic architecture Proof of Concept based on the revised plan.

## Recent Progress

- **Phase 1: Foundational Setup (Completed)**
  - Initial Project Setup, Basic Express Server and Routing, Dependency Injection with tsyringe, and Basic Agent Interface and Base Agent Class have been implemented.

- **Phase 2: Core Agent Implementation (Completed)**
  - Basic Input Validation Agent, Recommendation Agent, and Sommelier Coordinator have been implemented.

- **Phase 3: Integration and Testing (In Progress)**
  - Agents have been integrated with the `/api/recommendations` endpoint.
  - Basic Knowledge Graph Service interaction has been implemented, including resolving Neo4j connection and query parameter issues.
  - Data loading script (`scripts/loadWineData.ts`) is available and was used to populate the Neo4j database.
  - The basic end-to-end recommendation flow from API request through agents to Knowledge Graph Service is now working.
  - A basic integration test for the recommendations endpoint (`src/api/__tests__/recommendations.integration.test.ts`) has been created and is passing.
  - Existing validation tests in `src/api/__tests__/validation.test.ts` are currently failing and have been deferred for later investigation and fixing.

## Current Status

- The core end-to-end flow of the POC is functional.
- Key components (basic agents, coordinator, knowledge graph interaction) are in place.
- One integration test is passing, providing confidence in the core flow.
- Some existing tests are failing due to unresolved issues in the test environment or caching, which are currently blocking further test development and require external diagnosis.

## Next Steps (Following Revised POC Plan)

Proceed with Phase 4, Task 1: Implement User Preference Agent.
