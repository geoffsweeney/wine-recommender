# Proof of Concept (POC) Progress Summary

This document summarizes the progress made on the agentic architecture Proof of Concept based on the revised plan.

## Recent Progress

- **Phase 1: Foundational Setup (Completed)**
  - Initial Project Setup, Basic Express Server and Routing, Dependency Injection with tsyringe, and Basic Agent Interface and Base Agent Class have been implemented.

- **Phase 2: Core Agent Implementation (Completed)**
  - Basic Input Validation Agent, Recommendation Agent, and Sommelier Coordinator have been implemented.

- **Phase 3: Integration and Testing (In Progress)**
  - Agents have been integrated with the `/api/recommendations` endpoint.
  - Basic Knowledge Graph Service interaction has been implemented, including resolving Neo4j connection and query parameter issues.
  - Data loading script (`scripts/loadWineData.ts`) is available and was used to populate the Neo4j database.
  - The minimum end-to-end flow for **wine-to-ingredients matching** has been implemented and verified by a passing integration test.
  - The minimum end-to-end flow for **preference-based recommendations (by wine type)** has been implemented, including:
    - Updating the `SommelierCoordinator` to handle both ingredient and preference input.
    - Adding a `findWinesByType` method to the `KnowledgeGraphService`.
    - Modifying the `RecommendationAgent` to handle both input types and use the appropriate Knowledge Graph Service method.
  - Integration tests in `src/api/__tests__/recommendations.integration.test.ts` for both ingredient-based and preference-based recommendations are now **passing**.
  - Existing validation tests in `src/api/__tests__/validation.test.ts` are currently failing and have been deferred for later investigation and fixing.

## Current Status

- The minimum end-to-end flows for both wine-to-ingredients matching and preference-based recommendations (by wine type) are functional and verified by passing integration tests.
- Key components involved in these flows are in place and integrated.
- Other agents have basic inclusion in the `SommelierCoordinator` flow.
- Validation tests are failing, representing features or issues outside the scope of the completed minimum flows.

## Next Steps

Based on the original POC plan and deferred enhancements, potential next steps include:
1.  **Expand Preference Handling:** Implement logic in the `RecommendationAgent` and potentially add methods to `KnowledgeGraphService` to handle other preferences from the `RecommendationRequest` DTO (price range, food pairing from preferences object, exclude allergens).
2.  **Implement Dead Letter Queue:** Proceed with the implementation of the dead letter queue as previously discussed, leveraging the existing `DeadLetterProcessor` structure.
3.  **Implement Other Basic Agent Logic:** Add minimal functional logic to the placeholder agents (`ValueAnalysisAgent`, `UserPreferenceAgent`, `ExplanationAgent`, `MCPAdapterAgent`) to demonstrate their basic participation in the flow beyond just receiving messages.
4.  **Address Failing Validation Tests:** Investigate and fix the failing validation tests in `src/api/__tests__/validation.test.ts`.

Please let me know which of these next steps you would like to prioritize.
