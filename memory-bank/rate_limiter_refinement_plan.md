# Rate Limiter Refinement Plan

## Implementation Status (Based on Code Review) - Remaining

Based on the code review, this plan appears to be **Remaining**.

**Remaining:**
- All steps outlined in the plan, including:
    - Modifying `src/server.ts` to apply rate limiting specifically to the `/api` route and implement error handling.
    - Modifying `src/server/__tests__/rateLimiter.test.ts` to update test requests and remove/adapt tests.
    - The test file [`src/server/__tests__/rateLimiter.test.ts`](src/server/__tests__/rateLimiter.test.ts) was not found in the expected location.
