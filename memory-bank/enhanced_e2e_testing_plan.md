# Enhanced End-to-End Testing Plan for Recommendation Flow

## Overview
This plan aims to enhance the existing end-to-end tests for the recommendation flow by reviewing the component implementation, analyzing current tests, identifying additional test scenarios, and implementing new test cases.

## Implementation Status (Based on Code Artifacts)

This plan outlines steps to enhance end-to-end testing. Based on the code review, here is the status of the steps involving code artifacts:

**Completed (Based on Code Evidence):**
- Step 1: Review Component Implementation (I have reviewed `SommelierCoordinator` and `RecommendationAgent`).
- Step 2: Analyze Current End-to-End Tests (I have reviewed [`src/api/__tests__/e2e.test.ts`](src/api/__tests__/e2e.test.ts)).
- Step 4: Implement New Test Cases (Test cases exist in [`src/api/__tests__/e2e.test.ts`](src/api/__tests__/e2e.test.ts)).

**Remaining (Cannot fully confirm through code):**
- Step 3: Identify Additional Test Scenarios (Cannot confirm the extent of identified scenarios).
- Step 5: Refactor Existing Tests (if necessary) (Cannot confirm if refactoring has occurred).

Since the identification of *additional* scenarios and potential refactoring cannot be confirmed through code, this plan cannot be definitively marked as completed based on code evidence alone.

## Steps
1. **Review Component Implementation**
   - Examine the implementation of `SommelierCoordinator`, `RecommendationAgent`, and other relevant agents.
   - Ensure the implementation is correct and aligns with the expected functionality.

2. **Analyze Current End-to-End Tests**
   - Review the existing end-to-end tests in `src/api/__tests__/e2e.test.ts`.
   - Understand the current test coverage and identify any gaps.

3. **Identify Additional Test Scenarios**
   - Based on the component implementation and current test coverage, identify additional test scenarios.
   - Consider various input variations, edge cases, and potential error scenarios.

4. **Implement New Test Cases**
   - Create new test cases to cover the identified scenarios.
   - Ensure the tests are comprehensive, robust, and maintainable.

5. **Refactor Existing Tests (if necessary)**
   - Refactor existing tests to improve their structure, readability, and maintainability.

## Next Steps
Please review this plan and confirm if it meets your requirements. Once confirmed, I will proceed to implement the enhanced end-to-end tests.
