## Wine Recommendation System Implementation Checklist

### Completed: Agent Capabilities Implementation
- [x] Implement getCapabilities() across all agents
- [x] Add capability registration to AgentRegistry
- [x] Create integration tests for capability discovery
- [x] Verify all capability tests pass
- [x] Complete RecommendationAgent test coverage (100% public interfaces)

### Development Standards
- [ ] All components use dependency injection pattern
- [ ] DI container configured per project standards
- [ ] Modules follow single responsibility principle
- [x] 100% test coverage for public interfaces (RecommendationAgent, InputValidationAgent) - *Note: For agents with complex communication patterns, unit test coverage focuses on internal logic; inter-agent communication is primarily verified via integration tests.*
- [ ] Error handling follows centralized pattern
- [x] Documented test patterns for agent message handlers (see architecture-patterns.md)
- [ ] Logging meets observability requirements
- [ ] Configuration follows 12-factor app principles

## Wine Recommendation System Implementation Checklist
