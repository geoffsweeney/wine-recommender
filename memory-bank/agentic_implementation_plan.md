# Agentic Implementation Proof of Concept (POC) Plan - Revised

This plan outlines the steps to implement a Proof of Concept for the agentic architecture, focusing on getting a basic end-to-end recommendation flow working with core agents and knowledge graph interaction.

## Implementation Status (Based on Code Review)

### Completed:
- **Phase 1: Foundational Setup** (All tasks confirmed by code)
    - Task 1: Initial Project Setup
    - Task 2: Basic Express Server and Routing
    - Task 3: Dependency Injection with tsyringe
    - Task 4: Basic Agent Interface and Base Agent Class
- **Phase 2: Core Agent Implementation** (All tasks confirmed by code, with basic orchestration noted for Sommelier Coordinator)
    - Task 1: Implement Input Validation Agent (Basic)
    - Task 2: Implement Recommendation Agent (Basic)
    - Task 3: Implement Sommelier Coordinator (Basic Orchestration)
- **Phase 3: Integration and Testing:**
    - Task 1: Integrate Agents with API Endpoint (Confirmed by code)
    - Task 2: Basic Testing: Create basic integration test for recommendations endpoint (Confirmed by code)
    - Task 3: Implement Basic Knowledge Graph Service Interaction (Confirmed by code)

### Completed:
- **Phase 3: Basic Testing:** Fixed failing test in `SommelierCoordinator.unit.test.ts`.

### Partially Completed (Basic Implementation Exists, but further work needed as per plan/TODOs):
- **Phase 3: Basic Testing:** Fix existing failing tests in `validation.test.ts` (Deferred in plan, test file exists).
- **Phase 4: Advanced Features:**
    - Task 1: Implement User Preference Agent
    - Task 2: Implement Value Analysis Agent
    - Task 3: Implement Explanation Agent
    - Task 4: Implement MCP Adapter Agent (Simulated)
    - Task 5: Implement Agent Communication Bus (Core implemented, integration/advanced features remaining)
    - Task 6: Implement Shared Context Memory (Core implemented, integration/advanced features remaining)
    - Task 7: Implement Circuit Breaker, Retry Manager, Dead Letter Processor (Implementations exist, full integration/testing status unclear)

### Remaining (No significant code evidence reviewed):
- **Phase 4: Advanced Features:**
    - Task 8: Implement comprehensive test coverage for all new features.
    - Task 9: Deployment and Monitoring setup.
