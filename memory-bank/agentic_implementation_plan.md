# Agentic Implementation Proof of Concept (POC) Plan - Revised

This plan outlines the steps to implement a Proof of Concept for the agentic architecture, focusing on getting a basic end-to-end recommendation flow working with core agents and knowledge graph interaction.

## Phase 1: Foundational Setup (Completed)
- [x] Task 1: Initial Project Setup
- [x] Task 2: Basic Express Server and Routing
- [x] Task 3: Dependency Injection with tsyringe
- [x] Task 4: Basic Agent Interface and Base Agent Class

## Phase 2: Core Agent Implementation (Completed)
- [x] Task 1: Implement Input Validation Agent (Basic)
- [x] Task 2: Implement Recommendation Agent (Basic)
- [x] Task 3: Implement Sommelier Coordinator (Basic Orchestration)

## Phase 3: Integration and Testing (In Progress)
- [x] Task 1: Integrate Agents with API Endpoint
- [ ] Task 2: Basic Testing
  - [x] Create basic integration test for recommendations endpoint.
  - [ ] Fix existing failing tests in `validation.test.ts` (Deferred).
- [x] Task 3: Implement Basic Knowledge Graph Service Interaction

## Phase 4: Advanced Features (Iterative)
- [ ] Task 1: Implement User Preference Agent
- [ ] Task 2: Implement Value Analysis Agent
- [ ] Task 3: Implement Explanation Agent
- [ ] Task 4: Implement MCP Adapter Agent
- [ ] Task 5: Implement Agent Communication Bus
- [ ] Task 6: Implement Shared Context Memory
- [ ] Task 7: Implement Circuit Breaker, Retry Manager, Dead Letter Processor
- [ ] Task 8: Implement comprehensive test coverage for all new features.
- [ ] Task 9: Deployment and Monitoring setup.

## Next Steps
Proceed with Phase 4, Task 1: Implement User Preference Agent.
