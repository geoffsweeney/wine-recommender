# Plan for Populating Neo4j with Wine Data

**Goal:** Establish a strategy and implement the process for populating the Neo4j knowledge graph with comprehensive and relevant wine data to support accurate wine recommendations.

## Potential Data Sources

Several sources can be leveraged to acquire wine data:

1.  **Large Language Models (LLMs):**
    *   **Pros:** Can generate synthetic data, extract information from unstructured text, and potentially provide creative pairings or descriptions. Useful for filling gaps or generating initial data.
    *   **Cons:** Data accuracy and consistency can vary, requires careful prompt engineering and validation of output, potential for generating non-existent wines.

2.  **Publicly Available Datasets:**
    *   **Pros:** Can provide large volumes of structured data (e.g., wine characteristics, ratings, regions).
    *   **Cons:** Data format may require significant transformation, licensing restrictions, data quality can vary, may not include specific pairing information.

3.  **Wine APIs:**
    *   **Pros:** Provides structured, often up-to-date data directly.
    *   **Cons:** May require subscriptions or have usage limits, data coverage can vary, may not include specific pairing information.

4.  **Web Scraping (with caution):**
    *   **Pros:** Access to a wide range of information on wine websites and review sites.
    *   **Cons:** **Significant legal and ethical considerations (check terms of service!),** data is often unstructured and requires complex parsing, websites can change frequently, leading to broken scrapers. **Use with extreme caution and ensure compliance with all terms of service and legal regulations.**

5.  **Manual Data Entry:**
    *   **Pros:** High control over data quality and content, useful for curating specific pairings or rare wines.
    *   **Cons:** Time-consuming and not scalable for large datasets.

## Data Ingestion Process

A typical data ingestion process would involve the following steps:

1.  **Data Acquisition:** Obtain raw data from one or more of the identified sources.
2.  **Data Extraction/Parsing:** Extract relevant information from the raw data. This might involve parsing structured formats (like JSON or CSV) or using techniques like LLMs for information extraction from unstructured text.
3.  **Data Transformation:** Convert the extracted data into a format that aligns with the Neo4j knowledge graph model (defining nodes for Wine, Ingredient, Food, etc., and relationships like `:PAIRS_WITH`, `:HAS_CHARACTERISTIC`, `:FROM_REGION`).
4.  **Data Loading:** Use the Neo4j service (specifically the `createWineNode` and potentially new methods for creating other nodes and relationships) to load the transformed data into the database.

## Implementation Steps

1.  **Define Knowledge Graph Model:** Clearly define the node labels, properties, and relationship types that will represent the wine data in Neo4j. (Initial model with `Wine`, `Ingredient`, `Food`, `:PAIRS_WITH` exists, but may need refinement).
2.  **Select and Evaluate Data Sources:** Choose one or more data sources based on availability, data quality, licensing, and relevance to recommendation goals.
3.  **Implement Data Extraction and Transformation:** Write scripts or code to extract data from the chosen sources and transform it into the defined graph model. This might involve:
    *   Developing LLM prompts for data generation or extraction.
    *   Writing parsing logic for structured datasets or APIs.
4.  **Implement Data Loading Logic:** Enhance the `KnowledgeGraphService` ([`src/services/KnowledgeGraphService.ts`](src/services/KnowledgeGraphService.ts)) with methods to create different node types (e.g., `createIngredientNode`, `createFoodNode`) and relationships (e.g., `createPairsWithRelationship`).
5.  **Develop Data Ingestion Scripts/Processes:** Create automated scripts or processes to run the data extraction, transformation, and loading steps. This could be a one-time script for initial population or a recurring process for updates.
6.  **Implement Data Validation and Quality Checks:** Add steps to validate the data before loading it into Neo4j to ensure consistency and accuracy.
7.  **Integrate with Recommendation Flow (for LLM as a source):** If using the LLM to generate data when a query fails, modify the `RecommendationAgent` ([`src/core/agents/RecommendationAgent.ts`](src/core/agents/RecommendationAgent.ts)) to trigger the data generation and loading process before re-querying the knowledge graph.

## Success Criteria

- The Neo4j database is populated with a sufficient amount of relevant wine data.
- The data in the knowledge graph is accurate and consistently structured.
- The recommendation system can find relevant wines for a wider range of user inputs (preferences and ingredients) based on the populated data.
