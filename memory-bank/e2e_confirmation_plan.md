# Plan to Confirm End-to-End Recommendation Flow

This plan outlines the steps to confirm the end-to-end functionality of the core recommendation flow, from receiving user preferences to returning a wine recommendation.

## Implementation Status (Based on Code Artifacts)

This plan outlines a process for confirming the end-to-end flow through testing and manual verification. Based on the code review, here is the status of the steps involving code artifacts:

**Completed (Based on Code Evidence):**
- Step 1: Review Existing Tests (Existence of test files [`src/api/__tests__/e2e.test.ts`](src/api/__tests__/e2e.test.ts) and [`src/api/__tests__/search.e2e.test.ts`](src/api/__tests__/search.e2e.test.ts) confirms this was possible).
- Step 4: Enhance or Add Tests (Optional) (Test cases exist in the e2e test files).

**Likely Initiated/Partially Completed (Cannot fully confirm through code):**
- Step 2: Execute Existing Tests (Existence of tests implies they are run).
- Step 5: Execute Enhanced/New Tests (Existence of tests implies they are run).

**Remaining (Cannot confirm through code):**
- Step 3: Identify Additional Scenarios (Optional but Recommended).
- Step 6: Perform Manual Testing.
- Step 7: Interpret Results.

Since the execution and verification steps cannot be confirmed through code, this plan cannot be definitively marked as completed based on code evidence alone.

## Steps
1.  **Review Existing Tests:** Examine the current end-to-end tests for the `/api/recommendations` and `/api/search` endpoints in [`src/api/__tests__/e2e.test.ts`](src/api/__tests__/e2e.test.ts) and [`src/api/__tests__/search.e2e.test.ts`](src/api/__tests__/search.e2e.test.ts). Understand what they test and their limitations.

2.  **Execute Existing Tests:** Run the existing suite of end-to-end tests to confirm that the basic recommendation and search flows are working as expected with the current test cases.

3.  **Identify Additional Scenarios (Optional but Recommended):** Consider other scenarios for the recommendation flow that are not covered by the existing tests. This could include:
    *   Different wine types (white, sparkling, etc.)
    *   Various price ranges
    *   Different food pairings
    *   Requests with allergen exclusions
    *   Requests with incomplete or unusual preferences

4.  **Enhance or Add Tests (Optional):** Based on the identified scenarios, either enhance the existing tests or add new test cases in [`src/api/__tests__/e2e.test.ts`](src/api/__tests__/e2e.test.ts) to cover these additional situations. This will provide more robust end-to-end confirmation.

5.  **Execute Enhanced/New Tests:** Run the updated suite of end-to-end tests to verify the recommendation flow across a wider range of inputs.

6.  **Perform Manual Testing:** Manually test the recommendation flow through the application's user interface or API client. This involves sending various requests with different preferences and verifying the responses.

7.  **Interpret Results:** Analyze the results from both automated and manual testing. Successful test runs and manual confirmations indicate that the end-to-end recommendation flow is working correctly for the tested scenarios. Failures will point to areas that need investigation and debugging.
