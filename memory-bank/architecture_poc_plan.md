# Wine Recommendation App - Proof of Concept (POC) Plan (Revised)

This revised plan outlines the essential steps to create a working Proof of Concept for the Wine Recommendation App, focusing on implementing basic versions of all defined agents and demonstrating their interaction within the core recommendation flow.

## Implementation Status (Based on Code Review) - Completed

Based on the current codebase, this simplified Proof of Concept plan appears to be **Completed**.

### Completed:
- **Phase 1: Core Agent Development (Basic Functionality)** (All tasks confirmed by code)
    - Implement Basic Agents (Basic implementations of all listed agents exist).
    - Knowledge Graph Interaction (Core Agent) (RecommendationAgent interacts with KnowledgeGraphService/Neo4j).
- **Phase 2: Agent Integration & Basic Communication** (All tasks confirmed by code)
    - Simplified Agent System/Orchestration (SommelierCoordinator acts as coordinator).
    - Basic Agent Interaction Flow (Basic flow implemented in SommelierCoordinator).
    - Basic API Endpoint Integration (API endpoint integrates with SommelierCoordinator).
- **Phase 3: Basic End-to-End Flow & Testing** (All tasks confirmed by code)
    - Implement Basic End-to-End Flow (Basic flow from API to agents and back is implemented).
    - Basic Testing (Basic integration tests for the end-to-end flow exist).

### Remaining:
- All items listed under "Deferred Enhancements for Full System" are remaining *within the scope of this simplified POC plan*. However, as noted in the review of other plans, some of these deferred items have basic implementations in the current codebase.
