# Wine Recommendation App - Proof of Concept (POC) Plan (Revised)

This revised plan outlines the essential steps to create a working Proof of Concept for the Wine Recommendation App, focusing on implementing basic versions of all defined agents and demonstrating their interaction within the core recommendation flow.

## Revised Simplified Plan for Proof of Concept (POC) - Including All Agents

This plan focuses on implementing a basic version of all the defined agents and demonstrating their interaction within the core wine recommendation flow.

**Phase 1: Core Agent Development (Basic Functionality)**

*   **Goal:** Implement basic versions of all required agents with minimal functionality to enable interaction.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    1.  **Implement Basic Agents:**
        *   Create basic implementations for all agents listed in the architecture summary:
            *   `RecommendationAgent` (Focus on core recommendation logic and knowledge graph interaction).
            *   `ValueAnalysisAgent` (Basic placeholder or minimal logic).
            *   `UserPreferenceAgent` (Basic placeholder or minimal logic).
            *   `InputValidationAgent` (Basic input parsing/validation).
            *   `ExplanationAgent` (Basic placeholder or minimal logic).
            *   `FallbackAgent` (Basic placeholder or simple fallback response).
            *   `SommelierCoordinator` (Basic routing of requests to appropriate agents).
            *   `MCPAdapterAgent` (Basic placeholder or minimal interaction logic).
        *   Focus on getting the agents to compile and have basic input/output structures defined.
    2.  **Knowledge Graph Interaction (Core Agent):**
        *   Ensure the `RecommendationAgent` can interact with the `KnowledgeGraphService` and Neo4j for basic data retrieval.

**Phase 2: Agent Integration & Basic Communication**

*   **Goal:** Integrate the basic agents and establish a simplified communication flow between them.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    1.  **Simplified Agent System/Orchestration:**
        *   Implement a simplified version of the `LLMDrivenAgentSystem` or leverage the `SommelierCoordinator` to route incoming requests to the initial `InputValidationAgent`.
        *   Establish a basic mechanism for agents to pass control or information to each other. This could be a simplified in-memory message passing system for the POC, deferring the full Agent Communication Bus and Shared Context Memory.
    2.  **Basic Agent Interaction Flow:**
        *   Define and implement a basic interaction flow between the agents for a simple recommendation request (e.g., Input Validation -> Sommelier Coordinator -> Recommendation Agent -> Basic Response). Other agents can initially be bypassed or have placeholder interactions.
    3.  **Basic API Endpoint Integration:**
        *   Connect the existing `/api/chat` endpoint to the simplified agent system/orchestrator.

**Phase 3: Basic End-to-End Flow & Testing**

*   **Goal:** Get a basic end-to-end recommendation flow working through the integrated agents and perform initial testing.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    1.  **Implement Basic End-to-End Flow:**
        *   Ensure a request received by the API endpoint flows through the simplified agent system, involves the necessary agents (even if basic), interacts with the knowledge graph via the `RecommendationAgent`, and returns a basic recommendation response.
    2.  **Basic Testing:**
        *   Write and execute basic tests to verify the end-to-end flow.
        *   Manually test the flow to ensure a basic recommendation is returned.

**Deferred Enhancements for Full System:**

All the enhancements listed in the previous plan, including the full capabilities of the agents, robust infrastructure components (full Agent Communication Bus, Redis Streams for Shared Context Memory, comprehensive observability, detailed monitoring, advanced resilience, formal LLM protocols, full agent hierarchy/escalation, MCP integration), are deferred for the full system implementation after the POC.
