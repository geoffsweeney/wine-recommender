# Wine Recommendation App - Architecture Enhancement Plan

This plan outlines the steps to implement recommended improvements to the Wine Recommendation App architecture, focusing on enhancing resilience, observability, agent capabilities, and overall system robustness.

## Detailed Plan for Architecture Enhancement

This plan is structured into several key workstreams, focusing on building upon the existing architecture to improve resilience, observability, agent capabilities, and overall system robustness.

## Implementation Status (Based on Code Review)

### Completed:
- Structured logging is implemented ([`src/utils/logger.ts`](src/utils/logger.ts)).
- Basic OpenTelemetry tracing setup exists ([`src/tracing.ts`](src/tracing.ts)).

### Partially Completed (Basic Implementation Exists, but further work needed as per plan/TODOs):
- **Phase 2: Agent Development & Reasoning Enhancement:**
    - Task 1: Complete and Refine Key Agents (`ExplanationAgent` and `FallbackAgent` have basic LLM interaction).
- **Phase 3: Resilience & Monitoring:**
    - Task 3: Expand Observability Implementation (Completion) - Basic distributed tracing setup exists.

### Remaining:
- **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Observability Foundation:**
    - Task 1: Full Redis Streams Integration for Shared Context Memory.
    - Task 2: Strengthen Agent Communication Bus Persistence (Dedicated audit log).
    - Task 3: Expand Observability Implementation (Foundation) - Comprehensive OpenTelemetry integration and centralized logging system setup.
- **Phase 2: Agent Development & Reasoning Enhancement:**
    - Task 1: Complete and Refine Key Agents - Refinement, specific degradation scenarios for FallbackAgent, and thorough testing.
    - Task 2: Formalize LLM Reasoning Protocols (Chain-of-Thought, Reflection, Confidence Scoring).
- **Phase 3: Resilience & Monitoring:**
    - Task 1: Implement Detailed Knowledge Graph Monitoring.
    - Task 2: Define and Implement Clear Agent Hierarchy and Escalation Policies.
    - Task 3: Expand Observability Implementation (Completion) - Comprehensive metrics collection, time-series database, alerting, full distributed tracing integration.
- **Phase 4: Testing & Deployment:**
    - Task 1: Comprehensive Testing (Integration, Performance, Chaos Engineering).
    - Task 2: Deployment Updates (Docker, deployment scripts for new infrastructure).
