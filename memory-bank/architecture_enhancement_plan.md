# Wine Recommendation App - Architecture Enhancement Plan

This plan outlines the steps to implement recommended improvements to the Wine Recommendation App architecture, focusing on enhancing resilience, observability, agent capabilities, and overall system robustness.

## Detailed Plan for Architecture Enhancement

This plan is structured into several key workstreams, focusing on building upon the existing architecture to improve resilience, observability, agent capabilities, and overall system robustness.

**Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Observability Foundation**

*   **Goal:** Establish a solid foundation for enhanced context sharing, message persistence, and comprehensive system observability.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    1.  **Full Redis Streams Integration for Shared Context Memory:**
        *   Implement the necessary code to use Redis Streams for the short-term shared context memory, replacing the current in-memory placeholder.
        *   Define the structure of messages that will be published to the Redis Stream for context updates.
        *   Implement mechanisms for agents to publish and subscribe to context updates via the stream using Redis consumer groups.
        *   Configure Redis persistence (RDB or AOF) for the streams to ensure data durability.
    2.  **Strengthen Agent Communication Bus Persistence:**
        *   Based on the chosen message queue (Redis Streams or RabbitMQ), configure message and queue durability.
        *   Implement a mechanism to consume messages from the bus and store them in a dedicated audit log (e.g., a separate database table or a time-series database) for long-term persistence and easier querying.
        *   Define data retention policies for the audit log.
    3.  **Expand Observability Implementation (Foundation):**
        *   Integrate a comprehensive observability framework (e.g., full OpenTelemetry implementation).
        *   Ensure consistent propagation of trace and span IDs across all agent communications and service calls, leveraging the `correlationId` in `AgentEnvelope`.
        *   Implement structured logging across all components, including relevant trace and span IDs.
        *   Set up a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK stack, Loki).

**Phase 2: Agent Development & Reasoning Enhancement**

*   **Goal:** Complete the development of key agents and formalize the LLM reasoning protocols.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    1.  **Complete and Refine Key Agents:**
        *   Develop the knowledge base and reasoning logic for the `ExplanationAgent` to provide detailed and accurate wine explanations.
        *   Define and implement specific degradation scenarios and the corresponding behavior for the `FallbackAgent`.
        *   Thoroughly test the `ExplanationAgent` and `FallbackAgent` under various conditions.
    2.  **Formalize LLM Reasoning Protocols:**
        *   Define the exact implementation details for Chain-of-Thought prompting, Reflection, and Confidence Scoring within the LLM interactions.
        *   Integrate these protocols into the relevant agent workflows (e.g., `RecommendationAgent`, `SommelierCoordinator`).
        *   Develop initial evaluation metrics and a process for manually or semi-automatically evaluating the effectiveness of these protocols.

**Phase 3: Resilience & Monitoring**

*   **Goal:** Enhance system resilience and implement detailed monitoring for critical components.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    1.  **Implement Detailed Knowledge Graph Monitoring:**
        *   Identify key performance metrics for the Neo4j knowledge graph (e.g., query latency, resource utilization, connection pool usage).
        *   Implement metrics collection for Neo4j.
        *   Set up dashboards in the centralized monitoring system to visualize Neo4j performance.
        *   Configure alerts for performance degradation or errors in Neo4j.
    2.  **Define and Implement Clear Agent Hierarchy and Escalation Policies:**
        *   Formalize the agent hierarchy and document the responsibilities of each agent.
        *   Define explicit escalation policies for handling requests that an agent cannot process or that result in low confidence.
        *   Implement the logic for these escalation policies within the `LLMDrivenAgentSystem` or `SommelierCoordinator`.
    3.  **Expand Observability Implementation (Completion):**
        *   Identify and collect a comprehensive set of performance metrics from all system components (agents, communication bus, services).
        *   Set up a time-series database (e.g., Prometheus) and dashboarding tool (e.g., Grafana) for metrics visualization.
        *   Configure automated alerts based on key metrics and error rates.
        *   Integrate the distributed tracing system for end-to-end request visualization.

**Phase 4: Testing & Deployment**

*   **Goal:** Ensure the implemented enhancements are stable and prepare for deployment.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    1.  **Comprehensive Testing:**
        *   Develop and execute integration tests to verify the interactions between enhanced components (e.g., agents with Redis Streams, agents with the communication bus persistence).
        *   Conduct performance testing to ensure the changes do not introduce unacceptable latency.
        *   Perform chaos engineering experiments to test the resilience mechanisms (Circuit Breakers, Retry Manager, Fallback Agent) under failure conditions.
    2.  **Deployment Updates:**
        *   Update containerization configurations (Docker) to include Redis and any new monitoring agents.
        *   Update deployment scripts and configurations for the new infrastructure components.
